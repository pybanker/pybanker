## Focus âš¡
I am a financial-professional-turned-software-developer with focus on technologies for rapid development such as Django, React, Vue, and Jupyter Notebook.
### Fintech Professional
I am creating a new career model for finance grads that want to be practical and create tangible value. A big problem I see is that there's a huge skills/communication gap between finance and technology professionals that is holding back growth. As such, I specialize in i) fintech and ii) uniting the principles of finance & technology into one cohesive framework.
## Interests ðŸ§ 
- Financial modelling for Entrepreneurs
- Automation
- Algo/Systematic Trading bots
- Blockchain/DeFi
- Carbon Pricing
- Market Microstructure
## Principles ðŸ“œ
- The finance industry is (and will continue to be) data-driven
- Save time over saving money
## Goals ðŸ“ˆ
- Create the 'fintech' career model 
- Escape the 9-5
